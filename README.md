## About ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¶
KawaiiYuke is an entertaining web application designed to allow friends to come together to sing their hearts out. The web application connects to your Spotify Premium account to provide a variety of songs and lyrics to sing along to. With WebRTC, you're able to view your friends singing along with you through video chat for an optimal virtual karaoke experience! We understand how difficult it is nowadays to plan and coordinate in-person hang outs with friends so with this application, we aim to ease the process virtually!  

_What does "KawaiiYuke" mean anyways?_
<br></br>
We wanted to use the common parts of all our team members names along with the word 'Karaoke' and merge it together. We used the 'yu' in some of our names for 'yuke' and used the japanese word for 'cute', Kawaii, to use the 'w' and 'i' in our other team members name. Together, we came up with KawaiiYuke!
